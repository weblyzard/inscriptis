	abstract = {Sentiment analysis consists in the identification of the sentiment polarity associated with a target object, such as a book, a movie or a phone. Sentiments reflect feelings and attitudes, while emotions provide a finer characterization of the sentiments involved. With the huge number of comments generated daily on the Internet, besides sentiment analysis, emotion identification has drawn keen interest from different researchers, businessmen and politicians for polling public opinions and attitudes. This paper reviews and discusses existing emotion categorization models for emotion analysis and proposes methods that enhance existing emotion research. We carried out emotion analysis by inviting experts from different research areas to produce comprehensive results. Moreover, a computational emotion sensing model is proposed, and future improvements are discussed in this paper.},

This paper discusses different emotion models such as Ekman's emotion model, Plutchik's wheel of emotions and the Hourglass of Emotions.

the models are based on different assumptions and models that may be inspired by psychology or biology.
There is a clear distinction between feeling (primarily determined by the person's internal state) and emotion (triggered by the environment).
The discussed models cover a total of 65 different emotions.
there are emotional categories such as surprise which might not have a polarity or for which the polarity might depend on the context. This has also been confirmed by an experiment in which experts evaluated the polarity of 65 emotions.
OCC emotion model - calibrated by considering the author's personality based on openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion and neuroticism)

After summarizing methods to extract and disambiguate context information, we present visualization techniques to explore the lexical, geospatial and relational context of topics and entities referenced in these repositories. The examples stem from the Media Watch on Climate Change, the Climate Resilience Toolkit and the NOAA Media Watch - three applications that aggregate environmental resources from a wide range of online sources.

With such rapid information influx, investor decisions tend to be influenced by peer and public emotions. An effective methodology to quantitatively analyze the mechanism of information percolation and its degree of impact on stock markets has yet to be explored. In this article, we propose a quantitative media-aware trading strategy to investigate the media impact on stock markets. Our main findings are that (1) fundamental information of firm-specific news articles can enrich the knowledge of investors and affect their trading activities; (2) public sentiments cause emotional fluctuations in investors and intervene in their decision making; and (3) the media impact on firms varies according to firm characteristics and article content.},

Mere polarity detection, as provided by many existing methods, does not suffice to understand the emergence of collective awareness. Methods for extracting affective knowledge should be able to pinpoint opinion targets within a thread. Opinion target extraction provides a more accurate and fine-grained identification of opinions expressed in online media. This paper compares two different approaches for identifying potential opinion targets and applies them to comments from the YouTube video sharing platform. The first approach is based on statistical keyword analysis in conjunction with sentiment classification on the sentence level. The second approach uses dependency parsing to pinpoint the target of an opinionated term. A case study based on YouTube postings applies the developed methods and measures their ability to handle noisy input data from social media streams.},

This overview article discusses the transformer architecture, ground breaking models and open issues in the use of transformers for natural language understanding.
Background

most NLP research relies upon a sentence-to-sentence modelling:- input: x\_1, ... x\_n- output: y\_1, .. y\_n-1 - determine y\_n given intermediate representations z\_1, ... z\_n
solution: RNNs - predict y\_n given the distribution of previous inputs- problem:vanishing gradient problem; addressed by a forgetting mechanism- training time increases exponentially with the context vector
encoder-decoder architecture: - fed with input tokens x\_i- yields a hidden states h\_1, ... h\_n- the last hidden state is fed into a decoder which yields y\_1, ... y\_n based on h\_n and the decoders hidden state d\_1, ... d\_n
Transformers draw upon attention rather than recurrence.- recurrence is replaced by a stack of encoders and decoders- input x\_1, ... x\_n is projected into three vector spaces: (i) query (decoder), (ii) keys, and (iii) values (encoder)- queries: features relevant to the previous decoder- dot product yields the similarity between the input and the query keys- exponential softmax function increases the gap between relevant keys and less relevant ones.

Advantages of attention

multiple forms of attention identify relevant tokens
faster than recurrent layers, when the input sequence is shorter than the context vector

Types of attention

self-attention: correlates positions within the same sequence (e.g., sentence)
multihead attention: each attention head yields different weights (i.e., focuses on a different aspect of the problem) similar to an ensemble model.

Alternative approaches

CNNs: more parallelized
multi-step attention: decoder receives a matrix of attention weights from the previous decoder and computes its own

Unsupervised transformers

unsupervised pre-training based on large corpora
semi-supervised approaches are fine-tuned on task-specific data (e.g., BERT)
task agnostic: use a single model architecture across all tasks (e.g. by using a delimiter between input and target for summarization or question answering tasks)
GPT2: model size should allow for task solving tasks without the fine-tuning step.

Research directions

commonsense learning- RNNs outperform transformers when sentence lengths differ too much (!)- combine knowledge graphs or knowledge distillation with unsupervised pre-training- apply data augmentation and increase data diversity instead of data volume (e.g., by paraphrasing sentences for question answering tasks)
multitask learning

Enhancements

Transformer-XL model: map longer dependencies among the input tokens by caching context representations
RoBERTa optimizations for BERT-based models: use bigger training batches and remove the next sentence prediction (NSP) step
XLNet: learns dependencies independent of the token order (i.e., sequence of tokens)
ALBERT:remove the number of parameters by sharing parameters across layers (smaller models but computationally more complex)
GPT-3: large-scale model with 175 billion parameters; produces news articles that are hard to distinguish from human-written text.

Integrating domain knowledge

should help in mapping meaning rather than "statistical" predictions
two approaches:

knowledge graphs (leverage prior world knowledge that no longer needs to be stored in the model; reduces the attention search space; enables the ue of graph-based methods)
knowledge distillation (learn a compressed knowledge representation (student) from a huge (teacher model) while minimizing the performance loss- DistilBERT: 97 \% of model performance at 40\% of the size- Shallow models (shallow bidirectional LSTM achieves comparable results to ELMo with 1/100 of the parameters



Interesting: models that draw upon background knowledge (e.g., Amnervaz et al. 2018)},

Named entity linking in the business domain is a challenging task, since most state of the art methods rely upon comprehensive context information (e.g., from Wikipedia) that is not available for many business entities.
This paper, therefore, addresses an end-to-end neural entity linking model (JEL) that uses minimal context information and margin loss to generate entity embeddings and a Wide \& Deep Learning model that draws upon these embeddings for entity linking.
Method
The authors use (i) spaCy for entity recognition and (ii) their method for linking to identified entities.
Entit Embedding
triple loss model that selects

10 terms that are positive context examples for an entity, and
10 randomly selected negative examples (how representative are these examples; effectiveness?)

to compute contextualized entity embeddings Enitity Linking

Character matching: Wide Character Learning with subword information for matching entities (more effective than verbatim matching since it also considers typos)
Semantic matching: Use deep semantic embeddings to embed mentions based on the context into a vector. Compute the similarity between mention-vectors and entity-vectors based on Euclidean distance.

Application
similar to WISDOM - identify businesses in financial news and propagate the impact of the coverage (e.g., financial difficulties) along the supply chain.},

	abstract = {Recent years have seen the paradigm shift of Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems from sequence labeling to span prediction. Despite its preliminary effectiveness, the span prediction model's architectural bias has not been fully understood. In this paper, we first investigate the strengths and weaknesses when the span prediction model is used for named entity recognition compared with the sequence labeling framework and how to further improve it, which motivates us to make complementary advantages of systems based on different paradigms. We then reveal that span prediction, simultaneously, can serve as a system combiner to re-recognize named entities from different systems' outputs. We experimentally implement 154 systems on 11 datasets, covering three languages, comprehensive results show the effectiveness of span prediction models that both serve as base NER systems and system combiners.

The mining of social media is a complex process under progressive evolution, falling into three broad categories: listening (safety data reporting), engaging (follow-up), and broadcasting (risk communication). This systematic review is aimed at evaluating the usefulness and quality of proto-signals by social media listening. Areas covered: In this systematic search, performed according to MOOSE and PRISMA statements, we selected studies, published in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar until 31 December 2017, that listened at least one social media to identify proto-adverse drug events and proto-signals. Expert opinion: The selected 38 studies identified serious and unexpected proto-adverse drug events characterized by poorer information quality as compared with spontaneous reporting databases. This feature allows rarely the evaluation of causal relationships. Proto-signals identified by social media listening had the potential of anticipating pre-specified known signals in only six studies. Moreover, the personal perception of patients reported in social media could be used to implement effective risk communication strategies. However, signal detection in social media cannot be currently recommended for routine pharmacovigilance, due to logistic and technical issues.},

	doi = {10.1109/WIIAT50758.2020.00065},
	abstract = {Automatic extraction of forum posts and metadata is a crucial but challenging task since forums do not expose their content in a standardized structure. Content extraction methods, therefore, often need customizations such as adaptations to page templates and improvements of their extraction code before they can be deployed to new forums. Most of the current solutions are also built for the more general case of content extraction from web pages and lack key features important for understanding forum content such as the identification of author metadata and information on the thread structure.This paper, therefore, presents a method that determines the XPath of forum posts, eliminating incorrect mergers and splits of the extracted posts that were common in systems from the previous generation. Based on the individual posts further metadata such as authors, forum URL and structure are extracted. We also introduce Harvest, a new open source toolkit that implements the presented methods and create a gold standard extracted from 52 different Web forums for evaluating our approach. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that Harvest clearly outperforms competing systems.},

	copyright = {All rights reserved},
	abstract = {Web pages not only contain main content, but also other elements such as navigation panels, advertisements and links to related documents. Furthermore, overview pages (summarization pages and entry points) duplicate and aggregate parts of articles and thereby create redundancies. The noise elements in Web pages as well as overview pages affect the performance of downstream processes such as Web-based Information Retrieval. Context Extraction's task is identifying and extracting the main content from a Web page. In this research-in-progress paper we present an approach which not only identifies and extracts the main content, but also detects overview pages and thereby allows skipping them. The content extraction part of the system is an extension of existing Text-to-Tag ratio methods, overview page detection is accomplished with the net text length heuristic. Preliminary results and ad-hoc evaluation indicate a promising system performance. A formal evaluation and comparison to other state-of-the-art approaches is part of future work.},

	abstract = {With the success of large-scale pre-training and multilingual modeling in Natural Language Processing (NLP), recent years have seen a proliferation of large, web-mined text datasets covering hundreds of languages. However, to date there has been no systematic analysis of the quality of these publicly available datasets, or whether the datasets actually contain content in the languages they claim to represent. In this work, we manually audit the quality of 205 language-specific corpora released with five major public datasets (CCAligned, ParaCrawl, WikiMatrix, OSCAR, mC4), and audit the correctness of language codes in a sixth (JW300). We find that lower-resource corpora have systematic issues: at least 15 corpora are completely erroneous, and a significant fraction contains less than 50\% sentences of acceptable quality. Similarly, we find 82 corpora that are mislabeled or use nonstandard/ambiguous language codes. We demonstrate that these issues are easy to detect even for non-speakers of the languages in question, and supplement the human judgements with automatic analyses. Inspired by our analysis, we recommend techniques to evaluate and improve multilingual corpora and discuss the risks that come with low-quality data releases.},

In this paper, we exploit the signals embedded in URLs to label web documents at scale with an average precision of 94.5\% across different language pairs. We mine sixty-eight snapshots of the Common Crawl corpus and identify web document pairs that are translations of each other. We release a new web dataset consisting of over 392 million URL pairs from Common Crawl covering documents in 8144 language pairs of which 137 pairs include English. In addition to curating this massive dataset, we introduce baseline methods that leverage cross-lingual representations to identify aligned documents based on their textual content. Finally, we demonstrate the value of this parallel documents dataset through a downstream task of mining parallel sentences and measuring the quality of machine translations from models trained on this mined data. Our objective in releasing this dataset is to foster new research in cross-lingual NLP across a variety of low, medium, and high-resource languages.},

	abstract = {Common Crawl is a considerably large, heterogeneous multilingual corpus comprised of crawled documents from the internet, surpassing 20TB of data and distributed as a set of more than 50 thousand plain text files where each contains many documents written in a wide variety of languages. Even though each document has a metadata block associated to it, this data lacks any information about the language in which each document is written, making it extremely difficult to use Common Crawl for monolingual applications. We propose a general, highly parallel, multithreaded pipeline to clean and classify Common Crawl by language; we specifically design it so that it runs efficiently on medium to low resource infrastructures where I/O speeds are the main constraint. We develop the pipeline so that it can be easily reapplied to any kind of heterogeneous corpus and so that it can be parameterised to a wide range of infrastructures. We also distribute a 6.3TB version of Common Crawl, filtered, classified by language, shuffled at line level in order to avoid copyright issues, and ready to be used for NLP applications.},
