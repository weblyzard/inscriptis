Please feel free to address any of the following issues

high priority:
- finalize support for WhiteSpace.pre (pre)
- add a class that translates style sheets to the corresponding dictionary of `HtmlElement`s.
- add support for nested tags in white spaces (e.g. `ul ol`)


low priority:
- support for <hr /> tag (if needed)
